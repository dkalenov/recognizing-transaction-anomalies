# Recognizing anomalies in financial and crypto translations

1. Implementation Plan

a. Data Ingestion and Preprocessing  
• Load the Dataset: Load data from a CSV file.  
• Clean Data: Remove unwanted characters from numeric fields and convert fields to appropriate data types.  
• Feature Engineering: Derive additional features such as transaction time differences and frequency flags to enrich the data.  

b. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
• Analyze Basic Distributions: Visualize distributions of transaction values, token prices, liquidity, and market cap.  
• Examine Correlations: Identify multicollinearity to optimize feature selection.  
• Create Visualizations: Use heatmaps, bar charts, and scatter plots to observe feature relationships and identify patterns in the data.  

c. Model Training and Evaluation  
• Define Labels: Set conditions for labeling transactions as anomalies based on transaction frequency and transaction amount.  
• Split the Dataset: Separate data into training and testing sets using standard techniques.  
• Model Selection: Choose unsupervised models for anomaly detection, such as One-Class SVM, Isolation Forest, and DBSCAN.  
• Hyperparameter Optimization: Apply grid search or Bayesian optimization (e.g., Hyperopt) for model parameter tuning.  
• Neural Network Training: Design and train an Autoencoder to learn a compressed representation of normal transactions and detect anomalies as significant deviations from this baseline.  

d. Evaluation and Metrics  
• Evaluate Models: Calculate performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and silhouette score to assess model performance.  
• Model Comparison: Compare models based on these metrics to select the best-performing model for deployment.  

e. Alerting Mechanism and Confidence Scores  
• Confidence Scoring: Calculate confidence scores based on distance from decision boundaries or isolation scores.  
• Threshold Setting: Set probability thresholds for generating alerts.  

f. Saving Model and Results  
• Model Persistence: Save trained models for later use in anomaly detection.  
• Output Results: Export predictions with confidence scores for further analysis.  

g. Testing with Synthetic Data  
• Testing: Generate synthetic data and apply trained models to it, set alerting system.
